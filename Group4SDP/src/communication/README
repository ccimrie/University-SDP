Connecting: 
In order for your main method to connect to the brick you have to have the following code:

comms = new BluetoothCommunication(NXT_NAME, NXT_MAC_ADDRESS);
comms.openBluetoothConnection();

where NXT_NAME is the name of the device and NXT_MAC_ADDRESS is the bluetooth mac address.
Those can be found in ControlGUI.java as of the writing of this.

After connection is established you should see a notification in your java console and on the
brick.

After connection is established you can send commands in the form of integer array of 4 elements.
The first element of that array is going to be an opcode readed by the brick, and the rest 3 are
reserved for options, in case we need them (For example to define speed, direction and so on...)

Sending commands: Sending commands is done through the Bluetooth communication
class's method sendToRobot(int []) it takes an array of int, with size 4. The
first integer in the array is the opcode (reference the Brick.java file to see what
the opcodes should be) the next 3 integers are options that can be parsed for
some commands (like for example speed and direction of movement for a movement
command);

Receiving commands: Receiving commands from the Brick is done through the
Bluetooth communication class's method receiveFromRobot() which returns array of
4 integers. You can program those from the Brick.
