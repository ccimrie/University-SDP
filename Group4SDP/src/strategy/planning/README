A guide how to create your own strategy modules.

Refer to the example file Offensive.java.

Every strategy module will be a thread that is run by the main planner. It should extend the abstract
class StrategyInterface and implement Runnable.

It should have a constructor, as shown in the example java file.
It should have a run method whose body consists of a while loop that checks for the following
conditions: 

while (!shouldidie && !Strategy.alldie){

Those two booleans are the two ways we could specify that we want the thread dead. The shouldidie
variable is provided by the abstract class and is modified when the kill() method is run (also
provided by the abstract class). The other booleans is used when we want to kill the global strategy
system.

After the while loop is done you should always have an:
rc.stop() to prevent the robot from moving any further after the strategy is supposed to terminate.

If you have any questions, just ask (:
