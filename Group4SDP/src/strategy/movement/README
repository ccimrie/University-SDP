HOW TO USE THE MOVER:

The way to use a mover is the following:
First initialize a mover object with the following signature:
public Movement(WorldState worldState, RobotController robot)

After initializing movement you should set up the parameters you want

Movement move = new Movement(world,robot);
move.setUpMoveToPoint(130, 450);

For now there are seven different methods you can call. Look at the file
for more details.

After you set up the parameters you should initialize a thread and start it.

Doing a setup* method will not start movement. The only thing that would start
movement would be the thread.start(), which is explained below.

Afterwards intialize a new Thread and start it:

Thread movthread = new Thread(mover, "Movement Thread");
movthread.start();

Thus you start your desired move method. To check if it's finished do the folloing:

movthread.isAlive()
If this returns true, it means that the move method has not yet finished.

If you want to wait for move to finish do a 
movthread.join()

if you want to prematurely kill the thread do: 

if (movthread.isAlive()){
	mover.die();
}

this will kill the current movement command.
