HOW TO USE THE MOVER:

The way to use a mover is the following:
First initialize a mover object with the following signature:
public Movement(WorldState worldState, RobotController robot,
			int movetopointx, int movetopointy,
			int speedx, int speedy, double angle, int methodtouse)

the int methodtouse points out which of the three (or possibly more in the future
methods you want to call. The values are the following:

//1 move (x, y speed)
//2 for move (angle)
//3 for move2point 

You only need fill in the parameters you need to use (like in the case below
we wante to use move2point so we filled only movetopointx and movetopointy.
the rest are set to zero).

Movement mover = new Movement(world, robot, 150, 450, 0,0,0.0,3);

Afterwards intialize a new Thread and start it:

Thread movthread = new Thread(mover, "Movement Thread");
movthread.start();

Thus you start your desired move method. To check if it's finished do the folloing:

movthread.isAlive()
If this returns true, it means that the move method has not yet finished.

if you want to prematurely kill the thread do: 

if (movthread.isAlive()){
	mover.die();
}

this will kill the current movement command.
